# Benefits {#concept_ozf_jtv_tdb .concept}

## Ease to use {#section_l5q_n5v_tdb .section}

-   Supports creating container clusters with one click.
-   One-stop application lifecycle management based on containers.
-   Integrates with the Alibaba Cloud abilities of virtualization, storage, network, and security.
-   Supports graphical user interfaces and APIs.

## Secure and controllable {#section_mkb_s5v_tdb .section}

-   In Alibaba Cloud Container Service, your containers are running on your own Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instances and are not shared with others. Therefore, isolation issues between containers do not exist.
-   In terms of network, you can use a security group to define the access policies of ECS instances and containers in a container cluster, allowing or rejecting addresses of some sources to access the containers.
-   Mutual certificate verification is used by the management APIs of container clusters, avoiding the interface from being accessed by illegal users.
-   Special solutions for container security, such as neuvector, can be easily integrated with Alibaba Cloud Container Service to provide higher level of security protection.

## Protocol compatibility {#section_w52_x5v_tdb .section}
