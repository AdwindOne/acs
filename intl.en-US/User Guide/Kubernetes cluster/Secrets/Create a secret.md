# Create a secret {#task_vjn_p2z_b2b .task}

You have created a Kubernetes cluster. For more information, see [Create a cluster](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Kubernetes cluster/Clusters/Create a cluster.md#).

We recommend that you use secrets for sensitive configurations in Kubernetes clusters, such as passwords and certificates.

Secrets have many types. For example:

-   Service Account: Automatically created by Kubernetes, which is used to access Kubernetes APIs and is automatically mounted to the pod directory /run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount.
-   Opaque: Secret in the base64 encoding format, which is used to store sensitive information such as passwords and certificates.

By default, you can only create secrets of the Opaque type in the Container Service console. Opaque data is of the map type, which requires the value to be in the base64 encoding format. Alibaba Cloud Container Service supports creating secrets with one click and automatically encoding the clear data to base64 format.

You can also create secrets manually by using command lines. For more information, see [Kubernetes secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) .

1.   Log on to the [Container Service console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/cs). 
2.   Under Kubernetes, click**Application** \> **Secret**in the left-side navigation pane. 
3.   Select the cluster and namespace from the Clusters and Namespace drop-down lists. Click **Create** in the upper-right corner.

    1.  Name: Enter the secret name, which must be 1â€“253 characters long, and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens \(-\), and dots \(.\).
    2.  Configure the secret data. Click the **add** icon next to Name and enter the name and value of the secret, namely, the key-value pair. In this example, the secret contains two values: `username:admin` and `password:1f2d1e2e67df`.
    3.  Click **OK**.
5.   The Secret page appears. You can view the created secret in the secret list.
