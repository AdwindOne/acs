# Manage a release {#concept_tcp_sb4_vdb .concept}

The Alibaba Cloud Kubernetes service enriches the cloud marketplace, in which the app catalog and service catalog functions integrate with the Helm package management tool and allow you to build the application in the cloud quickly. A chart can be released multiple times, which requires you to manage the release versions. Therefore, the Alibaba Cloud Kubernetes service provides the release function, which allows you to manage the applications released by using Helm in the Container Service console.

## Prerequisites {#section_ldn_dc4_vdb .section}

-   You have created a Kubernetes cluster successfully. For how to create a Kubernetes cluster, see [Create a cluster](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Kubernetes cluster/Clusters/Create a cluster.md#).
-   You have used the app catalog function or service catalog function to install a Helm application. For more information, see [Simplify Kubernetes application deployment by using Helm](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Kubernetes cluster/Application Management/Simplify Kubernetes application deployment by using Helm.md#). In this document, use the wordpress-default application as an example.
