# Create a persistent storage volume claim {#task_bzy_scf_j2b .task}

You can create a persistent storage volume claim \(PVC\) by using the Container Service console.

-   You have created a Kubernetes cluster. For more information, see [Create a cluster](intl.en-US/User Guide/Kubernetes cluster/Clusters/Create a cluster.md#).Â 
-   If you have already created a storage volume, use a cloud disk to create a cloud storage volume. For more information, see [Use Alibaba Cloud cloud disks](intl.en-US/User Guide/Kubernetes cluster/Storage/Use Alibaba Cloud cloud disks.md#).

    By default, the storage claim is bound to the storage volume depending on the label alicloud-pvname. When the data volume is created by using the Container Service console, the storage volume is labeled by default. If the storage volume label does not exist, you must add a label before you select to bound this storage volume.


1.  Log on to the [Container Service console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com). 
2.  Under Kubernetes, click **Application** \> **Volumes Claim** in the left-side navigation pane to enter the Volumes Claims list page. 
3.  Select the target cluster and namespace, and click **Create** in the upper-right corner.

    -   **Volume claim type**: Consistent with storage volume, including cloud, NAS, and OSS types.
    -   **Name**: Enter the storage volume claim name.
    -   **Distribution mode**: Currently, only existing storage volumes are supported.
    -   **Existing storage volume**: Select to bound the storage volume of this type.
    -   **Total**: Claim usage, cannot be greater than the total amount of storage volumes.
    **Note:** If a storage volume already exists in your cluster and is not used, but cannot be found in **Select Existing Storage Volume**, maybe the alicloud-pvname label is not defined.

    If you cannot find an available storage volume, you can click**Clusters** \> **Volumes** in the left-side navigation pane. Find the target storage volume, click **Label Management** on the right. Add the corresponding label alicloud-pvname, the value is the name of the storage volume. The cloud storage volume defaults to the cloud disk ID as the name of the storage volume.

5.  Return to the Volumes Claims list, you can see that the newly created storage claim appears in the list.
